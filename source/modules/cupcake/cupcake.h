// cupcake.h — Cupcake UI public API
//
// Android 1.5 ("Cupcake")-style launcher: a home screen with a handful of
// pinned app shortcuts plus a bottom dock, and a separate full-screen app
// drawer (opened from the dock's center button) listing every registered
// app. Status bar + drag-down notification panel forked from Cardstack.

// Height of the Lollipop nav bar (Back/Apps/Recents) pinned to the bottom of
// the screen — lives on lv_layer_top() (see cupcake_ui.c's build_lp_navbar())
// so it renders above every app window regardless of z-order, same trick the
// status bar above already uses. Shared with cupcake_win.c so app windows
// (and anything they dock to their own bottom edge) stay clear of it.

// Icon-enhanced variant of purr_win_list_set_items() — same deferred-rebuild
// behavior as the portable version (see ck_list_set_items_async_cb()'s
// comment in cupcake_win.c), but each row also gets an icon glyph, matching
// lv_list_add_btn()'s own (list, icon, txt) shape. icons[i] is an LV_SYMBOL_*
// string constant or NULL for no icon — a font glyph, not a bitmap asset, so
// this doesn't need any new catcall_ui_t image-widget capability.
//
// Only meaningful when Cupcake (LVGL) is the active UI backend — this header
// is only usable by app code that both REQUIRES the cupcake component and
// guards every call behind #ifdef CONFIG_PURR_UI_BACKEND_CUPCAKE, falling
// back to the portable purr_win_list_set_items() otherwise (see msn.c).
