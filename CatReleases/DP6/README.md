# PURR OS — DP6 (Developer Preview 6)

Full-stack build of all 12 supported devices. Every device folder
has both split images and one pre-merged image, plus a `manifest.json`
recording chip/name/copied-files for all of them in one place.

## Flashing the merged image (recommended)

```bash
esptool.py -p <PORT> write_flash 0x0 PURR_OS_<device>.bin
```

## Flashing split images

```bash
esptool.py -p <PORT> write_flash \
  0x0     bootloader.bin \
  0x8000  partition-table.bin \
  0x10000 firmware.bin \
  <spiffs_offset from device.pcat>  flash.bin
```
